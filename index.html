                <p>The Bald Eagle has been my favorite animal for as long as I can remeber.
                    I completed a report on the Bald Eagle way back in the 3rd grade and remember some of the things I 
                    included in the report.  The Bald Eagle is not only the patriotic symbol of the United States, but it 
                    is one of the leading birds of prey throughout North America. The Bald Eagle has a wingspan up to 80.3 inches andcan weigh
                    up to 105-222 ounces.  The Bald Eagle gets its famous white head and brown plumage after about 5 years.
